# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes. It uses **three machine learning models**:

- 🧠 Logistic Regression  
- 🌳 Decision Tree  
- 🌲 Random Forest  

The user inputs medical information through a **Streamlit web app**, and the system provides predictions from all three models.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts heart disease using 13 clinical parameters.
- Trained with real patient data.
- Compares results across 3 ML models.
- Clean and interactive UI using Streamlit.
- Easy to use and deploy.
